  This is some filler information! I have nothing else to say yet, but when I do come up with something useful I will deffinetly put it in here! This is just to make the site look pretty.

   <a href="http://www.personsofinterestbklyn.com/">LINK TO WEBSITE TO COMPARE</a>


    I think this is a great website for a barber shop. I was looking at their booking page and it has all of the elements that a booking page should have. A lot of the html elements are readable to me and make sense, but it looks like a lot of it is edited with javascript. I would like to learn javascript or ruby so that I can make a page similar to this (BUT BETTER)
